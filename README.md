Search Algorithms on large graphs
=======================

This is Java based library for search and trace algorithms used in large networks, like the social networks and communication networks.

Functionality - For Communication Networks -> Create a minimum spanning tree for the network, find a System on network, find the nearest system, find the cost of communication between 2 machines.

Functionality - For social networks -> find friends, friends of friends, find the degre of closeness, suggest friends,...

To run the code -> make some appropriate I/O of your choice, one such I/O implementation is given in <pre>MakeGraph</pre> class.
